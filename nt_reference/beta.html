                        NT finally on steam.. release date set for JULY 4th. (Pending approval from Valve). Should be good to go.. the only bug is unfortunately it can't be run higher screen res then 1920 X 1200, otherwise the UI breaks and you can't click buttons cause the alignment goes funky (like offset by certain amount of pixels). SORRY FOR THAT BIG MONITOR PPL! Maybe run windowed on big ass monitors using 1920 X 1200 ?

                                Hello everyone reading this... We just updated NT with a few new maps, and some weapon re-models.. and finally fixed the infamous "left-lean bug".. so now there is NO SHAME IN LEANING LEFT because you are now appropriately exposed like you would expect from a corner lean. So veteran players just need the PATCH INSTALLER.. and new players should get the FULL INSTALLER..

                                            <br />Hey all, we're releasing the NT Client Patch 1 this friday (10-23-2009) finally. It addresses a bunch of existing issues with the current release, and includes 7 new maps plus a night version of nt_dawn_ctg now called "nt_dusk_ctg." Hopefully we can get a changelog together and post it here or on the forums sometime soon. We've updated our <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/neotokyo/images" class="ver10" target="_blank">ModDB
                        page</a> with some media showing the maps that are being included in the patch.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />On a random note, Gabe Newell and Erik Johnson of Valve Software came by my worksite the other day during their Australia trip (I work in New Zealand). So I managed to get a picture with Gabe when my boss was giving him a tour around the building. I'll do a little write up and show and tell in my next post.

We'll be getting a game-info/manual thing up in the next couple of days hopefully. We realize it seems weird to release a game with no explanation of how to play it, but I guess that's how we roll!?! Anyways we'll correct that as soon as we can.

These actually pop up between rounds during your class/weapon selection, but if you'd like to have a look at them before the game comes out, <a href="neotokyo_noob_hints.html" class="ver10">here you go</a>. They mainly cover our initial release gameplay type "capture the ghost," with some other tips and hints thrown in. We'll periodically make more (as needed) for the other game types coming in future releases.

We've just got a few things to tidy up (double checking to make sure maps don't have problems like not enough spawns for large player counts, working with server admins to see if their admin tools are essentially compatible with NT, fine tuning a couple weapons for balance, etc..) We're also going to try and get the word out a little more aggressively by doing the usual PR stuffzzzzz.
                                                                <br />

As soon as we've locked down these things, we'll post it up.

The rest of the maps will be released with whatever patching needs to be done in the weeks after that. (bug fixing, fixing exploits, etc..)
